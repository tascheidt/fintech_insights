# `web/lib/scrapers` — agent context

ATS scrapers used by the Next.js side of the pipeline. The Python side has its own scrapers in `src/scrapers/`; that's the legacy CLI flow.

Entry point: `fetchJobs(atsType, atsIdentifier, careersUrl?, browser?)` in `index.ts`.

## API scrapers (run inline, cheap)

These hit the ATS provider's JSON endpoint. They run inside Vercel functions and complete fast.

- **`lever.ts`** — Lever boards.
- **`greenhouse.ts`** — Greenhouse boards.
- **`workable.ts`** — Workable boards.
- **`ashby.ts`** — Ashby boards.

## Browser scrapers (offloaded to GitHub Actions)

These need Puppeteer because the ATS doesn't expose a clean JSON feed. They are too long-running / memory-heavy to run reliably inside a Vercel cron, so the live flow offloads them via `triggerScrapeWorkflow` in `web/lib/github.ts`, which `workflow_dispatch`-es `.github/workflows/scrape-heavy.yml`.

- **`dayforce.ts`** — Dayforce boards.
- **`scotiabank.ts`** — Scotiabank custom careers site.
- **`browser.ts`** — Generic Puppeteer helpers (`scrapeJobsWithBrowser`, `scrapeGenericJobBoard`, `scrapeSuccessFactors`).

### `browser.ts` is 1131 LOC — leave it alone pre-launch

Resist the urge to refactor `browser.ts` before launch. It works. The complexity is load-bearing — selector heuristics, retry logic, and per-site quirks are baked in. Post-launch, split it by site and add tests; before launch, do not.

## ATS detection

- **`detect-ats.ts`** — `detectATSFromUrl` infers the ATS type from a careers URL. Used by the company-onboarding flow.

## Shared

- **`types.ts`** — `JobData` shape and `jobToRow` mapper to the DB row.
- **`utils.ts`** — Shared HTML/text helpers.
- **`index.ts`** — Factory + re-exports.

## Adding a new ATS

1. Decide: API or browser-based?
2. Create the file (`web/lib/scrapers/<name>.ts`) implementing the shared `JobData` shape.
3. Add a `case "<name>":` to `fetchJobs` in `index.ts`.
4. If browser-based, route through `scrape-heavy.yml` — do **not** add a new browser scrape on the Vercel hot path.
5. Add the company config (see `config/companies.yaml` for the Python side; `web/lib/scrapers/detect-ats.ts` for the web side).
6. Update this file with a one-line description of the new scraper.
